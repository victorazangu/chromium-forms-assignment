            You receive a higher benefit if you use a UnitedHealthcare provider. 
            This can be especially cost effective when receiving ongoing services 
            like physical therapy or when purchasing durable medical equipment.

            After processing your claim, you’ll receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB 
            explains the charges applied to your deductible (the amount you pay for covered 
            services before your plan begins to pay) and any charges you may owe the provider. 
            Please keep your EOB on file in case you need it in the future. You may also review 
            your EOB information on myuhc.com.
